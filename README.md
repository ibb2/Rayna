# pMusic

pMusic is an alternative music player for Plex focusing on desktop usage. Inspired by Spotify, pMusic is an alternative
to Plexamp, which has a less than stellar desktop interface.

**Note: this is currently completely online only and a major work in progress, but local. No support yet for offline
usage or caching.**

## Usage/Examples

On install login to you Plex account, that is all.

## Installation

There are 2 different methods to install pMusic

1. Clone the repo and build (If you choose this option you should know how to do this).
2. Choose the right executable for your operating system from the releases page.

## Features

- Cross platform (macos, windows, linux)
